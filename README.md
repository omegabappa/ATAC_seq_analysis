# ATAC_seq_analysis
This guide provides a detailed overview of ATAC-seq analysis, specifically tailored for members of the Takaku Lab. While many general resources exist for learning and analyzing ATAC-seq data, this document is designed to serve the specific needs of our lab, which routinely generates large volumes of such data.

All tools, settings, and workflows described here have been tested and optimized for use on the Takaku Lab servers â€” Chromatin and Sakura.
